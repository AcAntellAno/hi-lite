## The Problem:

As humans, we have very short attention spans. We are extremely busy and we hardly have time to sit and read. Well, to keep up with the trend, we want to help make getting information faster. We want to create a web application fused with AI and ML to help the user get the summary of any particular article they choose. A TLDR for every blog and news story. :alien:

## The Solution:

In order for this to happen, we can do 1 of 2 things. We can use the smmry api to handle the TLDR for us, or we can build out our own and get our percent of error as low as possible.

## The Stack:

We will be using a few technologies that we are comfortable with and they are as follows:

## Frontend

- HTML5
- CSS3
- Materializecss

## Backend

- Nodejs
- Express
- Ejs for templating

## DB

- MongoDB, although the rumors of DB's being dropped is off puting... :alien: :anger:
- Mongoose for the object data mapper

## To Run Application

          1. Git clone this repo
          2. Run `npm install`
          3. Run `npm start`
